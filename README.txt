A filter visualization tool made with MobMuPlat and Pure Data for a iOS and Android.

The software requires MobMuPlat to run, install it from the app store for your mobile OS. Then put all files except the pdf and readme on the phone. Detailed instructions can be found at http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/

The repo does not include sound files. First, download some .wav files you want to use. They should be actual songs or just as long, so you don't have to restart them.
Change the names of the songs in the .pd file to the files you want to use. Then put the .wav files together with the .pd and .mmp files.  

You can also make your own interfaces for other devices, just point to the same .pd file and include all inputs and outputs and it will work.
